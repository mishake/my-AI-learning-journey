# My AI Learning Journey

## Day 1: CartPole AI Agent

**What I did:**  
- Installed Python, Gymnasium, and Stable Baselines3  
- Faced lots of errors with pip, swig, and dependencies  
- Finally trained my first AI agent using PPO in CartPole  
- Watched the AI learn to balance a pole â€“ I was shocked it worked after many errors

**What I learned:**  
- Installing Python packages is sometimes messy, but solvable  
- Reinforcement learning is like training a robot brain through rewards  
- I can do this after all

**Next steps:**  
- Try a new environment like MountainCar  
- Start learning how PPO actually works
